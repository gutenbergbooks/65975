<h2 class="nobreak" id="Introduction"><i>Introduction</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The making of a man is a process of time, of training
and of progress. The babe, indeed, may be
born perfect in physical proportions and in possession of
normal faculties; but no product of Nature may stand still.
Growth or decay is the lot of every one, and the man—the
full and perfect man—is the result of physical and
mental development.</p>

<p>There has never been a time when physical development
has received so much attention as at present, or
when its importance has been so greatly appreciated.
Physical culture and exercise in the open air have resulted
in making men and women stronger and healthier, and
consequently more graceful in carriage and figure and
better fitted to enjoy the pleasures and perform the duties
of life. The conviction is now general that to produce
the highest type of man the cultivation and development
of the physical structure should proceed with the cultivation
of the mind; but on the other hand, the wise do not
admit that the practice of devoting too much attention to
athletics should be encouraged, however prevalent this
practice may be said to be at many leading colleges. The
proper ratio should be observed.</p>

<p>It is not desirable, to be sure, that the race should
become one of ignorant giants, but nevertheless the
value of exercise and of physical work cannot be disputed.
The right to pursue this value should be shared by all
mankind. Fortunately it has been made possible now,
as it formerly was not, for those who have lost limbs
to indulge in rightful exercise and perform necessary
physical work notwithstanding their misfortunes. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
activities of life, with their resulting benefit, are no longer
denied them.</p>

<p>Surgery, the scientific making of mechanical devices
for the correction of deformities, and the manufacture of
artificial substitutes for lost limbs, have led in the advance
of methods intended to better the condition or ameliorate
the suffering of humanity.</p>

<p>Time was when the loss of a leg meant the stumping
through the balance of life on a crotched stick. There
was Peter Stuyvesant, for instance, whose portrait is shown
on the cover of this catalogue. He lost a leg in the wars
in the West Indies in 1640. Thereafter, during the
time he was the last Dutch Director General of New
Netherlands—from 1647 until his surrender to the
English in 1664—and to his death in New York in 1682
at the ripe old age of eighty, he pegged his way along.
He was a man well able to afford the best in life, but
nothing better than the ordinary peg leg was then obtainable,
and so for forty years or more Peter Stuyvesant suffered
the inconvenience due to the crude device.</p>

<p>Now, fortunately for the afflicted, better things are
possible. Science and art have combined so successfully
in the manufacture of our artificial limbs that not only is
the wearer free from discomfort but he is enabled to
continue his career of activity, and pursue, as may be
necessary, his labors for a livelihood. Besides, the perfection
of design and manufacture of these aids makes
their presence difficult of detection.</p>

<p>Not only is ordinary labor well performed, but many
remarkable feats are accomplished by wearers of limbs of
our manufacture. A few instances are cited below.</p>

<p>A noted pitcher of a baseball team and a remarkable
bicycle rider, although deprived in early life of both legs
by accident, is able to hold a position of prominence in
his profession.</p>

<p>An operator constantly on his feet in a signal tower
suffers no inconvenience. After making five experiments
he has found finally that the artificial leg with which
we have equipped him is the most comfortable he has
ever worn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span></p>

<p>A crack bicycle rider, both of whose legs have been
amputated, one above the knee and one below, pronounces
our substitute faultless. He is able not only to
mount and dismount with ease but to perform all manner
of tricks and fancy riding, doing this as well as his competitors
blessed with sound, muscular, natural limbs.
Besides, he has a mile track record of 2.37.</p>

<p>Money will not buy happiness, but it will aid in its
attainment. Money will not compensate for the loss of a
limb, but it will buy a fair substitute if one knows where
to procure it.</p>

<p>One having a valuable and delicate watch needing
repairs would naturally be very cautious into whose hands
it was entrusted. In the event of sickness we are apt to
be very careful into whose care we place the patient.
Careful inquiry is made as to the reliability of the physician
and his experience, whether or not he has been successful,
if he understands his business and is honest in his
purpose; if his advice will be given in the best interests
of the patient, or whether his own profit is of first importance
to him.</p>

<p>It is entirely proper to ask similar questions in regard
to the makers of artificial limbs; but too often people are
careless in the matter, and place the case in the hands of
almost anybody in the business, without regard to responsibility
or reliability. Thus the remedy secured is often
worse than the disease. The strictest investigation should
be made. A competent maker should be selected. The
case being entrusted to him, the minor details should be
left to his judgment, with faith that his experience and
thorough understanding of his business will produce the
best result.</p>

<p>No single style of limb is suitable for all cases. Appropriate
and distinct construction is necessary, that the
limb shall meet the requirements of the person who is to
be compelled to wear it. Recognizing the truth of this,
we have been led to the study of the peculiarities and individual
needs of each case presented to us. Our limbs
are constructed with such a variety of joints and attachments
that each appliance may be accurately adapted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
any variation in the condition or occupation
of the patient. If any doubt
exists as to the result in any case, we
give ample opportunity for experiment
at our expense. It is for this reason that so many purchasers
have spoken in the highest terms of praise of our
efforts and the results.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus1.jpg" width="400" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We do not seek to discredit other manufacturers, but
simply, in full confidence, we state that we are the makers
of the best goods obtainable. In the pages following we
have endeavored to convey some idea of the ingenuity and
artistic skill which we bestow upon our work.</p>

<p>For over forty years—in fact, since 1856—we have
conducted our business in Rochester without interruption
and with increasing prosperity. Until 1876 the business
was conducted by Dr. Douglas Bly, who founded it.
Then for twenty years Mr. Fuller personally continued
the business, until in 1896 the present company was incorporated
under the laws of the State of New York with
a paid-up capital of $25,000. The patience and skill
exercised throughout these years have evolved the limb we
term “The Walk-Easy Leg,” and placed us at the head
of manufacturers of artificial limbs. Our efforts have been
always to improve and perfect—to excel at every point.
We are assured that these efforts have met with approval.
We enjoy the confidence of those who have found need of
our services. As a further evidence that we have successfully
sought to excel, it may be stated that during the past
twenty years, notwithstanding active competition, we have
supplied the United States Government with one-quarter
in number of all the limbs furnished to pensioners. We
also have supplied officially the States of Virginia, Georgia,
South Carolina and Louisiana. Furthermore, our work
has been placed in the first class by various scientific boards
convened for the purpose, and it has received the endorsement
of the world’s most famous surgeons.</p>

<p>Aside from the personal testimony of the multitudes
throughout the country who have availed themselves of
our experience and skill, and have offered to bear witness
to the good we have done them, we refer as to our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
financial standing and reliability to Dun or Bradstreet
mercantile agencies, or to any bank or public man in
our city or vicinity.</p>

<p>Intending purchasers are invited to correspond with
us, that they may receive, if they are necessary or desirable,
fuller details than are covered in this work. We
are always glad to receive inquiries and offer suggestions
for the comfort of our customers.</p>

<h3><i>Amputations</i></h3>

<p>It is probable that such a publication as this
will be read only by those who have lost limbs or
by their immediate friends. To advance an opinion
here as to the length of stump or the kind of
operation best adapted to the subsequent application
of an artificial limb would be of little benefit,
and might, indeed, suggest dissatisfaction to the
sufferer and cause injury to the operator. The
preservation of life is the object of amputations.
Surgeons generally appreciate the importance of
the operation and their own responsibility. They
undertake it with reluctance. Often during such
an operation exigencies arise or unforeseen conditions
so present themselves as to preclude any
observance of suggestions relating to the selection
of a point for amputation and preparation of the
stump for the exercise of the restorative art of
prosthesis. Then the surgeon has no choice if he
would save life. It is better not to criticise the
operation and malign the operator, but to believe
the best results possible under the circumstances
have been attained and be thankful that the outcome
is no worse.</p>

<h3><i>Treatment of the Stump</i></h3>

<p>In preparation for the application of an artificial
leg, and as soon as it is healed sufficiently to
permit it without pain or irritation, the stump
should be kept tightly bandaged from the end up
to the knee, if the amputation be below, or up to
the body if the amputation be above the knee.
The bandaging will diminish and solidify the
stump, leaving it in a much more desirable condition
for fitting and rendering the successful use
of a leg more a matter of certainty. If neglected,
the chances are that a soft, flabby stump will be
the result, which will rapidly reduce after the
patient begins the use of a leg, but a refitting or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
an uncomfortable amount of filling up in the socket
to compensate for the shrinkage of the stump will
be necessary in order to walk with the least degree
of ease or satisfaction. The remaining joints, particularly
the knee joint, should be kept in motion
as much as can be conveniently, every day; this
will prevent their becoming anchylosed (stiff and
inflexible). Should this warning come too late,
and the joint is already anchylosed, it should be
gently and gradually exercised, and oily, relaxing
applications applied until straightened and flexible.
A free daily use of the cold water bath and brisk
rubbing will prove beneficial. An application of a
solution of tannin and alcohol will toughen the
skin, and in many cases it would be an excellent
thing to continue the use of this solution after an
artificial leg has been applied.</p>

<h3><i>How Soon After an Amputation</i></h3>

<p>There is a diversity of opinion as to how
early a substitute may be applied. Many surgeons
strongly urge that an artificial leg cannot be safely
fitted for several months after cicatrization occurs,
while, on the other hand, some manufacturers of
artificial limbs claim that a leg can be satisfactorily
fitted just as soon as the stump has healed, no
matter if it be but five or six weeks after the
amputation.</p>

<p>Much, of course, depends upon the condition
of the patient, in circumstance and constitution.
It many times occurs that while the edges of the
flaps have united, and cicatrization appears, ossification
at the sawn end of the bones has not taken
place, consequently the necessary pressure and
tension on the surrounding integuments and other
adjacent parts in wearing a leg will unavoidably
cause inconvenience, irritation and pain. It is
therefore our opinion, based upon experience and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
observation, that in
most cases an artificial
leg should not be
fitted within <i>three
months</i> after amputation, and that if the edges
of the wound have thoroughly united at the
end of that time it is <i>unnecessary to wait longer</i>,
except to harden and reduce the stump by
bandaging, if this has not previously been done.
There are many good reasons why a leg should
be applied as soon as practicable after this time
(provided that the stump has healed), the chief one
being that there is nothing that will discipline and
strengthen a stump and remaining joints as quickly
and as effectually as the use of a properly fitted
artificial leg.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus2.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<h3><i>Material of Construction</i></h3>

<p>The materials used in the construction of
artificial limbs are, principally, tough English willow,
leather, metal and rubber. The wood parts,
when worked to the desired shape, are covered
with parchment or rawhide and finished with a
flesh-tinted waterproof enamel.</p>

<h3><i>Artificial Legs for Children</i></h3>

<p>When children have been deprived, by accident
or disease, of one or both lower limbs, artificial
legs should be applied as soon as the condition of
the stump will safely permit. It is too generally
presumed that an outgrown limb is of no further
use, and that the purchase of an artificial leg before
full growth is assured means a foolish expenditure.</p>

<p>This is wrong, at least so far as our work is
concerned; there are artificial legs made that it
would be very expensive to lengthen or change, but
any leg that is made by us, or under our name or
supervision, we will agree to lengthen at any future
time, as necessity may arise, at a cost not to exceed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
five dollars, and in many cases not to exceed three or
four dollars. When the amputation is above the
knee, it is often necessary that the leg be lengthened
both above and below the knee-joint. This involves
more labor and consequently greater expense, but
in no case will the charge exceed five dollars.</p>

<p>For a very young child we would make the
artificial foot one or two sizes larger than the
natural one; in a year or so the natural foot will
reach the size of the artificial, and some months,
perhaps years, will elapse before the natural foot
will be perceptibly larger than the artificial. This
method keeps the feet nearer the same size a longer
time than would be the case if the artificial foot were
made the same size as the natural foot in the first
place. When it is necessary to increase the size
of the foot it can be easily and inexpensively done.</p>

<p>When children are deprived of these useful
appendages, solely from fear or apprehension that
they may be outgrown, a lasting injustice is done
them. There is great danger of deformity and
disease from the prolonged use of crutches, particularly
at a tender and susceptible age; and the most
natural, easy, graceful walkers on artificial legs are
those who commence the use of them in youth; the
habit becomes thoroughly formed, and the continued
use of them from childhood develops and
strengthens the muscles and joints in a more
effectual manner than can be accomplished by any
other process or treatment.</p>

<h3><i>Weight of Artificial Limbs</i></h3>

<p>It is not possible to reduce the weight of artificial
legs below a certain point without sacrificing
strength and good wearing qualities. The leg we
construct weighs from two to five and one-half
pounds, but in some special cases where extreme
strength is required this may be exceeded. Much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
depends, however, upon the weight and occupation
of the wearer. Many legs of other makes which
weigh no more than ours require more of an effort
to carry and swing them, because the action of the
rubber spring in the back part of our leg assists
materially in carrying the leg forward while in the
act of walking, thus relieving the stump from the
effort that would otherwise be required to swing it.
We aim to have sufficient weight around the joints
to support them securely; at other points, where
strength is not required, they are left a mere shell.
The weight of an artificial arm is much less, varying
from one-half to one and one-half pounds.</p>

<h3><i>Durability of Artificial Limbs</i></h3>

<p>The occupation of the wearer has much to do
with the durability of an artificial leg, but more
depends upon the care and attention it receives.
We know of limbs that have been in constant use
for eighteen or twenty years and are undoubtedly
good for several more years of good service, and
others, equally well made in every way, that because
of neglect and abuse have lasted only three
or four years. These are the extremes, however.
The average durability of an artificial leg we estimate
to be from seven to eight years. Artificial
arms not being subject to the strain and wear of a
leg will last much longer, the average time, we
should say, being double that of a leg. It should
be borne in mind, however, that they are but a
mechanical imitation of Nature and require attention
the same as any other piece of mechanism,
and that it pays to keep them at all times clean
and in good working order, and that the better the
care the better and more lasting will be the service.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—While preparing this article Mr. John S. Havens, of
Plainwell, Michigan, called upon us wearing an artificial leg made at
this factory in the spring of 1864, and the leg is still in excellent
condition.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span></p>

<h3><i>How to Proceed in Ordering a Leg</i></h3>

<p>A very common error is prevalent in the minds
of many that artificial limbs are kept on hand in full
assortments and varieties, and that it is only necessary
for a person to call and purchase one and
wear it away, the same as you would a pair of boots
or shoes. Artificial legs are only made to order,
and it is preferable that the patient be present at the
factory for a day or two to have the leg fitted and
give it a thorough and satisfactory trial. Write to
us, stating full particulars of the case—when amputated,
whether below or above the knee, length
and condition of the stump, etc. Also state the
price you wish to pay for a leg, and whether or not
it will be practicable for you to come here and have
it fitted. If you can come here, name a day that
will be most convenient for you to do so, and we
will be ready for you. If possible, also specify time
of day and by which route you will arrive in
Rochester; if you are unable to determine in season
to advise us by mail, please do so by telegraph, and
we will have some one meet you at the station.
A shoe will be wanted here for the artificial foot.
Your presence will be required from one to two
days, depending upon the difficulty in fitting and
the number of orders we have on hand; during this
time you will have an opportunity of putting the
leg on, and giving it a thorough trial in the rough.
After you are satisfied with the test, you may return
home and the leg will be completed and forwarded
to you in about ten days, or, if you prefer to remain
and wear it home, it will be finished in about a week.
Excellent hotel accommodations can be obtained
for one dollar per day or five dollars per week.</p>

<h3><i>Making Artificial Legs from Measurements</i></h3>

<p>For the benefit of persons who do not care to
incur the expense and inconvenience of a journey
to the factory, we have perfected a chart for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
measurements, and directions for taking profiles,
plaster of paris moulds, etc., that overcome all the
difficulty and expense of a personal visit. To
make success doubly sure, when so desired we put
the leg up in the rough and forward it for trial;
this gives the same opportunity of trying it that
would be had here. The leg can then be returned to
us with directions as to any changes that may be
needed. To be sure, there is some expense for
transporting the leg, but it is small compared with
the cost of a journey here. A good share of our
orders are being filled in this manner, and with
unvarying success. Indeed, there need be no
fear or hesitancy in sending orders to us for
artificial legs to be made from measurements, as
we <i>guarantee a fit</i>. Should it prove otherwise,
we will make any required alterations without
charge.</p>

<h3><i>Warranty</i></h3>

<p>The following is a copy of the warranty given
with each leg. The time of the warranty will
depend entirely upon the price paid. See prices
of the various styles.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Rochester, N.Y.</span>, ______ 19__.</p>

<p>In consideration of the sum of __ dollars,
received from ______ of ______ for an artificial leg, we
hereby warrant the same, as follows: In case any part
of said leg should, on account of poor material or bad
workmanship, break or give way within __ years from
the date hereof, we agree to repair the same without
charge, provided that, as soon as any defect is discovered,
the leg, or any part thereof that needs to be repaired or
replaced, be forwarded to us without delay, and at the
expense of the owner. It is not the intention of this
warranty to make good without charge the unavoidable
wear of the leg, or breakage caused by accident, neglect
or misuse.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span></p>

<h3><i>Prices</i></h3>

<p>Our prices are graded in such a manner as to
make it possible for any one to secure one of these
reliable limbs, and are governed entirely by the
quality of the work and the time for which the
limb is warranted, and bear an exact proportion to
the cost of production and the probable cost of
repairs during the term of the warranty. We have
plans, which we will be very glad to explain to any
who desire to know about them, whereby these
limbs may be obtained without the expenditure of
any money whatever. Simply the giving of a little
time and persistent work. Scores have earned
limbs in this way.</p>

<h3><i>Remittances</i></h3>

<p>Should be made by express, post office or express
money order, registered letter, or New York
draft, whichever is most convenient for the sender.</p>

<h3><i>Terms</i></h3>

<p>It is our custom, as it is with all makers of
special appliances of this kind, to require in each
case a cash deposit as a guarantee of good faith.
When the purchaser is present at the factory for the
purpose of having a limb fitted, the limb may be
tried in the rough before making any payment;
if the fit and trial are satisfactory, one-half the
price will be required. When limbs are made
from measurements, without the presence of the
patient at the factory, one-half the price of the
limb ordered should accompany the order. In both
cases when the limb is finished it will be delivered
by express C.O.D. with the privilege
of examination and trial before making
the final payment.</p>

<p>A careful consideration of the
following facts should convince
any fair-minded person that this
plan is not only reasonable and
just but very necessary.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="400" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span></p>

<p>Each limb is made expressly to order for some
one individual, and the limb when completed is of
little or no value to any one except the person for
whom it is made. It requires some degree of
patience and perseverance to overcome the awkwardness
and possible disappointment associated
with the first trial of an artificial limb, and if there
be no obligation and no sacrifice on the part of the
would-be purchaser provided the limb is not accepted,
there is a possibility of its being declined,
and the maker, through no fault of his work,
becomes the loser. On the other hand, the
advance payment made on the limb insures
a very persistent effort on the part of the
purchaser to wear it, resulting in success and
satisfaction.</p>

<p>The purchaser may rest assured that the work
will not be slighted in any degree whatsoever, and
that it will be our duty and pleasure to make any
changes necessary to insure comfortable use of the
limb any time within a reasonable period after it
is finished.</p>

<h3><i>Installment Payments</i></h3>

<p>We can consistently make a limb and accept
installment payments therefor only on the following
conditions: On payment of one-half the price of
the limb with the order, the balance may be paid
in amounts and at times—if within reason—to
suit the purchaser; say five dollars each month
until paid for, provided that these payments are
secured by notes made or endorsed by some reliable
business man, or other equally good security. We
are perfectly willing to give time for a part payment
as stated, but must insist that we be amply
secured against loss from any cause whatever, and
we cannot entertain any proposition wherein this
is not provided for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span></p>

<h3><i>In Writing</i></h3>

<p>Describe your case as clearly and briefly as
possible, stating whether amputation is above or
below the knee or elbow, when amputated, length
and condition of the stump, your age, weight and
occupation, whether you have ever worn an artificial
limb, if so, how long and what make or makes,
and be particular to write your name and address
plainly, giving the post office, county and state.
Any inquiries that are made on the subject of artificial
limbs will be promptly answered to the best
of our knowledge, and any information that we
can give will be cheerfully imparted.</p>

<h3><i>Artificial Limbs for U. S. Pensioners</i></h3>

<p>Every officer or enlisted or hired man who
has lost a limb, or the use of a limb, in the military
or naval service of the United States, is entitled to
receive once every three years an artificial limb or
apparatus. Necessary transportation to the manufactory
and return, by the most usual and direct
route, will be furnished to those desiring it for the
purpose of having artificial limbs fitted, but will
not be furnished except for this purpose. Sleeping-car
accommodations will be given upon request.</p>

<p>In March, 1891, the law was amended so as
to allow an artificial limb every three years instead
of every five as before. The reduction in time
took effect in various ways but was to be counted
from March 1, 1891. The act operates in three
ways:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>First.</i> Those who were entitled on or after March
3, 1888, are entitled every three years from such last date.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> Those who were entitled between March 3,
1886, and March 3, 1888, were again entitled March 3,
1891, and every three years from that date.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> Those who were entitled before March 3,
1886, were again entitled five years from such date, and
again every three years.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span></p>

<p>On request of any soldier we will give him
the exact date on which he is entitled to an order
for a leg or for commutation.</p>

<p>Each officer and soldier has his choice either
to receive a limb or its equivalent in money. All
who want limbs will gain by taking one from the
Government, because the Government will give
transportation to and from the manufactory, the
cost of which in many cases is equal to the value
of the limb. Besides, the Government requires
each manufacturer to warrant his work and material
used. The soldier who draws his money and
buys a limb for himself loses all these advantages.
Many manufacturers of limbs will advise soldiers
to draw the money and then buy of them, so they
will not be obliged to warrant their limbs to the
Government, or give a bond for the same.</p>

<p>We furnish legs and arms for all kinds of
amputations, on Government orders. The necessary
blanks on which the applications should be
made for limbs and transportation will be furnished
to any soldier on application.</p>

</div>

</div>

<h3><i>The Latest Progress in Artificial Limb Construction</i></h3>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Walkeasy</span> leg is one of the more recent
of the long list of our artificial limb products.
The name signifies more than is ordinarily supposed
by the public at large, and is only comprehended
as it should be by those who are so
unfortunate as to require an artificial leg possessing
the requisites indicated by the name <span class="smcap">Walkeasy</span>.
To make the new leg such as to truly maintain
this name will be our aim and effort in all cases.</p>

<p>As the weight of the body is imposed upon
the artificial leg, under a high pressure, changing
from naught to the entire weight of the body, and
at times to double that weight or more, the least
particle of chafing or friction would soon cause
soreness and might continue to that extent that
the limb would be impossible of good, and, moreover,
a source of much injury to the wearer. The
amputation of a leg, therefore, requires on the part
of the artificial leg a double degree of responsibility;
the limb must not only fit the remaining mutilated
part of the leg comfortably, but must reproduce the
general motion to a greater or lesser degree of perfection.
These are delicate features of artificial
limb production, and in no way are they more
perfectly reproduced than in the <span class="smcap">Walkeasy</span> leg.</p>

<p>The improvements represented by the <span class="smcap">Walkeasy</span>
leg are not simply theoretical. We have
been quietly experimenting with them for years,
not in the shop only, but they have been put into
practical use by wearers, of various professions
and occupations—the correct way of testing an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
appliance of this kind; otherwise we would not
dare hazard our reputation on their success.</p>

<p>The most approved points of excellence in
both the ordinary rubber and wooden feet are
combined in the <span class="smcap">Walkeasy</span> foot. The rubber
and wooden feet, as commonly constructed, while
possessing desirable features, are objectionable and
unsuitable in many cases—the rubber foot on
account of its rigid, motionless ankle, and the
wooden foot on account of the hard, unyielding,
springless material of which it is constructed. In
the <span class="smcap">Walkeasy</span> foot both of these features are
entirely done away with and the desirable ones
preserved.</p>

<p>The following are the eminently desirable
features of the <span class="smcap">Walkeasy</span> leg, a combination of
which is not to be found in any other artificial leg
manufactured:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>First.</i> The removable sponge-rubber sole of the
foot imparts a soft, noiseless tread, does not cut the stockings,
gives a natural appearance in the shoe, relieves the
wearer of much strain and jar in walking, greatly assists
the ankle springs in their action, producing an increased
lifelike motion, and greatly reduces the chances of breakage
of any part of the leg.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> The yielding rubber at bottom of foot provides
for a little lateral or side motion, enough for all
practical purposes.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> The ankle joint is strongly constructed. A
substance composed of fibre, in which plumbago (black
lead) is incorporated, is used as a bearing on the ankle
bolt or cylinder, making a lubricating and most satisfactory
joint.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i> The sponge-rubber or felt sole, which can
be easily and quickly removed and cheaply renewed or
repaired without the necessity of procuring a new foot in
case of wear or breakage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span></p>

<p><i>Fifth.</i> No mechanical toe joint, the flexibility of
the rubber or felt giving the desired motion.</p>

<p><i>Sixth.</i> The cords or tendons come in contact with
no surfaces to cause friction or wear and are adjustable so
as to give any desired mobility to the ankle joint.</p>

<p><i>Seventh.</i> Knee joints, for amputation below the
knee, with four bearings, taper phosphor bronze bushings,
and taper bolts, giving the greatest degree of wearing surface
and requiring the least possible lubrication.</p>

<p><i>Eighth.</i> The purchaser has the choice of a wood
socket, leather lacing socket, or the <span class="smcap">Neverchafe</span> spring
socket, which ever is best adapted and most suitable for the
peculiarities of his case, and for amputation below the knee
an extra attachment is included for use in place of the
knee joint and thigh lacer, at such times as it may suit the
wearer to try it.</p>

</div>

<p>The best product in this line, if within the
means of the purchaser, should be the one chosen;
but while the <span class="smcap">Walkeasy</span> leg possesses so many
eminent features it is not more costly than the
average product of other manufacturers. Moreover,
our guarantee is that if it fails in realizing to
the wearer what is promised to him, we are more
than willing to secure the point of perfection without
extra charge, and make of it for the wearer his
ideal and not ours.</p>

<h3><i>Sectional View of the Improved Walkeasy Leg</i></h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/figure260-263.jpg" width="350" height="700" alt="260 261 262 263" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span></p>

<p>No. 260. Some changes have been made in
the ankle joint, but the notable modifications are a
foot with thick sponge-rubber removable sole, K-K,
in place of the rubber-covered core; for thigh amputations
an adjustable steel knee cord and spring
piston, combined in one piece, E, and knee-joint
tightener, A.</p>

<p>The removable sole gives us an opportunity
of strengthening the upper part of foot with a rawhide
covering. Between the wooden part J and
the rubber K at the toe part, layers of canvas and
sole leather are placed to prevent breaking or
turning up of the toe. This, however, is hardly
necessary in most cases, but we consider it an
additional protection. With rubber-covered cores
the rubber first breaks away from the top of the
core at the toe part, resulting in turning up of the
toe, leaving little chance to repair it satisfactorily
without making a new foot. This cannot very
well take place with the rubber sole, as there is no
rubber above the wood to break away. If, however,
it becomes necessary for any reason to renew
the rubber, the sole can be removed by simply
taking a screw out at the bottom of foot, and a
new sole or part of a sole put on at a trifling
expense without sending the leg to us, as we keep
on file a pattern of each individual foot made.
The greater security by which the cord ends and
the ankle-joint rods are kept in place, and the
convenient method of getting at them, are additional
strong points commending the change. See
No. 261.</p>

<p>The combination knee cord and spring consists
of a steel rod carefully bushed at the joint and
extending through a hickory bar in calf of the leg,
with a thick, soft leather washer on the rod under
the bar, and a nut at the end of rod that is reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
with thumb and finger through holes in back of leg
for readily adjusting the length. For the knee
spring a suitably protected heavy elastic web is
slipped over end of the rod and adjusted from outside
of leg with buckskin strings; as leg is flexed
in act of walking, the rod is forced through the
hickory bar, stretching the web and forcing the
lower part of the leg forward in position for next
step; when lower part of leg is flexed at right
angles with the thigh, as in sitting, the pressure of
spring is automatically released. This change simplifies
the knee-joint construction, is lighter and
more convenient of adjustment.</p>

<p>Figs. 262 and 263 illustrate a new knee joint
for amputation below the knee. This is the latest
and decidedly the most compact, lightest, and at
the same time the best wearing joint that we have
ever adopted, not excepting the ball-bearing joint,
and is recommended in all cases.</p>

<p>Joints of medium weight are usually applied.
A heavier joint of same pattern is used, however,
when the wearer is unusually heavy or desires an
extra strong joint and does not mind the additional
weight. Let us see if we can describe the
uniqueness of it, so that it will be understood.</p>

<p>The head of the joint is very thin (three-eighths
of an inch), permitting the trousers to set
smoothly; at the same time there is as much
wearing surface as in an ordinary joint of twice
the thickness. C is a phosphor bronze (the
toughest of metal) taper bushing fitted into a taper
hole. B is a taper bolt fitting a taper hole in the
bushing; when drawn into place with screw A, the
bushing is wedged into male joint head E tightly,
so that it is practically a part of this male head.
In swinging the leg the movement or wear is on
the bolt B inside the cone bushing, giving as much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
wearing surface as a joint with male head as thick
as this bushing is long. Perhaps it will be better
understood by reference to separate cuts of the
bolt B and bushing C, and stating that the bolt
turns or moves inside the bushing only, and that
there is no wearing surface except between these
two parts.</p>

<p>Parts A, B and C are all made to a size and
interchangeable. Any one of them taken from
stock will fit any joint head of this pattern without
special fitting, so that it may be conveniently
replaced in case of wear.</p>

<h3><i>The Haberl Patent Foot With Tarsal Articulation</i></h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/figure264-265.jpg" width="350" height="350" alt="264 265" />
</div>

<p>The novelty of this invention is in the point
of articulation being near the bottom of the foot
instead of at the ankle. It does not give as much
motion as the ankle-jointed foot, but is much
superior to the rigid ankle without a joint. The
construction is so simple that little explanation is
required. The dotted lines in No. 264 represent
hickory plates, covered with sponge rubber, and
No. 265 shows the manner in which the parts are
put together. The heel part is slipped into the
round hole in hollow of foot, and the piece taking
the place of the ball and toe part of foot is passed
through into the heel part, as shown by dotted
lines in No. 264, and locked together with a steel
pin, making a complete hinge. In finishing, the
sponge rubber parts are covered with buckskin or kid.
The entire arrangement is so simple there is very
slight probability that any repairs will be required
that the wearer cannot make himself, and the ease
and little expense with which the parts can be
renewed commend it to all who require a strong,
serviceable leg. It seems to be a favorite among
miners and others following rough, heavy work
who have given it a trial.</p>

<h3><i>Attachment for use in place of Thigh Lacer and Knee-joint</i></h3>

<p>In most cases of amputation below the knee,
if stump is sound and of good length, it is possible
to comfortably use a leg without the steel knee-joint
and thigh support. Many express a desire to
try a leg of this description, but hesitate to have a
leg so constructed, fearing the result of continually
taking the entire weight or bearing on the stump,
with no provision for relieving it. For such as
would like to try, at their convenience and pleasure,
a leg without the thigh support, we make
attachment No. 211. The thigh lacer and upper
joints can be removed by taking the knee-joint
bolts out and this attachment substituted. At such
times and in such work, when the thigh support
would be more desirable, it can be readily replaced.
This attachment is included with the $100 <span class="smcap">Walkeasy</span>
leg without extra charge; with any other
style of leg, price $5.</p>

</div>

<h3><i>Neverchafe Spring Socket</i></h3>

<p>This is a leather socket moulded over a cast
of the stump, and suspended to the inner side of a
wooden socket or shell with adjustable rubber
webbing in such a manner as to avoid all friction
or chafing of the stump and to give a comfortable,
helpful spring at each step of the wearer, the sensation
being much the same as though the weight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
were on an air cushion, with no pressure on the
end of the stump whatever. No. 212 for amputation
below the knee; No. 213 for amputation
above the knee.</p>

<p>This socket is particularly suitable for short
stumps. The inner socket, being made of stiff
leather, practically lengthens the stump, giving
increased leverage, a condition greatly to be desired
in such cases. It is also a very great relief to
tender and sensitive stumps; the slipping and rubbing
occasioned more or less in walking on an artificial
leg, takes place with this attachment between
the inner spring socket and the outer wood socket;
the pressure of the springs keeping the inner socket
snugly against the stump in all positions, precludes
the possibility of any friction on the stump.</p>

<p>For stumps that become swollen in hot
weather, or that require extra covering in cool
weather, or for such as have never used an artificial
leg, with the consequent probability of the stump
rapidly reducing, this inner socket may be made
adjustable by lacing.</p>

<p>While this is undoubtedly the most suitable
and comfortable socket for very short and sensitive
stumps, some prefer the highly polished wooden
socket, and others the adjustable leather lacing
socket. All purchasers of the <span class="smcap">Walkeasy</span> leg have
their choice of socket; the selection should be
influenced by the length and condition of the
stump, the weight and occupation of the wearer,
and other considerations. In all cases we guarantee
a comfortable socket and one that will not
chafe.</p>

<h3><i>New Adjustable Leather Lacing Socket</i></h3>

<p>This new socket is for amputation below the
knee. The adjustment is made at the back of the
socket instead of at the front, as in the lacing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
sockets heretofore made. The improvement is so
marked that the wonder is we did not make the
change earlier. Much of the weight on the stump
is taken just where the socket was previously made
to open, and it was necessary to reinforce the lacing
with a strap. When laced in the back of socket
the front is stronger, more comfortable, and dresses
more smoothly; furthermore, there is more shrinkage
of a stump in the calf than in front; and in
being able to make the adjustment in the back part
of the socket, it is kept nearer the shape that will
conform to the shape of the stump than when laced
in front. This socket is illustrated in the various
engravings representing legs for below the knee
amputation. See frontispiece, No. 204, No. 227
and No. 228.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Part_II"><span class="smcap">Part II</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In this part we give descriptions and illustrations
of ordinary styles of legs, such as we have
made here—with various modifications and improvements,
as suggested by time, wear and experience—for
forty-five years. Excepting the <span class="smcap">Walkeasy</span>
leg, described in Part I, there are no better
nor more reliable artificial limbs made anywhere by
anyone, <i>and the prices are much below</i> those charged
by other manufacturers.</p>

<p>The various styles are:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Wooden foot with ball-and-socket ankle joint
and wooden socket.</p>

<p>Wooden foot with ball-and-socket ankle joint
and leather lacing socket.</p>

<p>Wooden foot with hinge ankle joint (army
and navy or two-ball) and wooden socket.</p>

<p>Wooden foot with hinge ankle joint (army
and navy or two-ball) and adjustable leather lacing
socket.</p>

<p>Foot with sponge-rubber or felt removable
sole and rigid ankle and wooden socket.</p>

<p>Foot with rigid ankle and adjustable leather
lacing socket.</p>

</div>

<p>The cords and springs used in the legs with
articulated ankle joints are the same as are used in
the <span class="smcap">Walkeasy</span> leg. The springs are rubber used
by compression, imparting easy, uniform motion,
their power and action being regulated by simply
turning a nut, so that the wearer may adjust them
to suit his own peculiar gait.</p>

<p>In walking, when the weight of the body
rests on the ball of the foot, the spring in the back
part of the leg (heel spring) is firmly compressed,
and when the weight of the body is thrown forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
on to the other foot the spring rises and carries the
foot forward to its place with very little effort of
the wearer, assisting greatly in carrying the weight
of the leg.</p>

<p>The prices for legs described in this part, for
amputation at any point above the ankle, are,
including suspenders, stump socks, etc., complete:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>$50, warranted for one year.</p>

<p>$60, warranted for three years.</p>

<p>$70, warranted for five years.</p>

</div>

<p>A copy of the warranty is given on <a href="#Page_18">page 18</a>.</p>

<p>Just as good a leg in every way is made for
$50 as is made for $70, the difference in price
being determined wholly by the time the warranty
is made to cover.</p>

<p>If undetermined as to which leg would be
best adapted to any particular case, and it is left to
our judgment to select, upon receipt of measurements
and full particulars we will construct the
one we honestly and conscientiously believe will
give the most lasting and comfortable service. We
are equally interested with the purchaser in doing
this, as the continued good name of our establishment,
as well as our future prosperity, depend
wholly upon the durability of our work and the
comfort with which it is worn.</p>

<h3><i>Ball-and-Socket Ankle Joint</i></h3>

<p>This joint is formed by a polished glass ball
plying in a socket of vulcanite, the foot and ankle
being joined together with four tendons, passing
through rubber springs in the ankle; this joint
admits of every motion the natural ankle has. In
walking on the side of a hill or inclined plane, or
where the foot is used to brace the body, the ankle
flexes laterally and the foot remains flat on the
ground, thus giving a firm base of support. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
motion closely imitates the movement of the natural
ankle, and this joint is desirable for light work
and short, tender stumps. Notwithstanding it is
more complicated than any of our other styles,
requiring more care and attention, there are hundreds
of people using it with such comfort and
satisfaction that under no circumstances whatever
could they be induced to use any other. No. 216,
on <a href="#Page_40">page 40</a>.</p>

<h3><i>Double Ball-and-Socket Ankle Joint</i></h3>

<p>This joint is a unique invention, and the
idea of its construction was suggested by the single
ball-and-socket joint. It consists of two polished
glass balls plying in sockets of fibre. There is no
substance that could be used for this purpose that
presents a harder, smoother surface than glass, and
when in the shape of solid polished spheres, plying
in perfectly fitted sockets, they are practically indestructible;
there is no such thing as wearing
them out. A linked steel rod and a back and
front tendon securely connect the foot and ankle.
The tendons, also the rubber springs, are the same
as used in all of our legs, and are applied in the
same manner. This is a somewhat lighter joint
than the army and navy joint and is recommended
for persons of light or medium weight. No. 217,
on <a href="#Page_40">page 40</a>.</p>

<h3><i>Army and Navy Ankle Joint</i></h3>

<p>The axis of this joint consists of a hollow
steel bolt securely fastened in the foot with two
vertical rods with nuts at the lower ends. The
bolt is stationary in the foot, the ankle working on
the upper surface of the bolt, leaving no possible
chance for an accumulation of any grit or dirt,
thus making a self-cleaning joint. The steel rod,
together with the front and back cords, connects
the foot and the ankle. Provision is made for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
tightening the ankle rod with a nut on the upper
end, so as to regulate the friction on the bolt and
to compensate for any wear that may take place
at the joint. This is recommended as being the
strongest and most serviceable of the wooden feet.
No. 218.</p>

<h3><i>A New Foot with Rigid Ankle</i></h3>

<p>This is not properly a rubber foot, but a
modification of the so-called rubber foot suggested
by improvements on our <span class="smcap">Walkeasy</span> foot. In
the construction of the old-style rubber foot a
wooden core is covered with rubber and properly
cured or vulcanized by heat. It is impossible to
strengthen or reinforce this wooden core with a
covering of rawhide as is done on the other parts
of an artificial leg, because the heat necessary in
vulcanizing the rubber burns and ruins the rawhide.
This is obviated by the method of construction
of this new foot.</p>

<p>The upper part of the foot is firmly attached
to the ankle part by a pin, and the entire wood
part is covered with rawhide. Thus the upper
part of the foot forms practically one piece with
the ankle, and strength is gained without adding
weight. The sponge-rubber removable sole is
fitted into a recess channeled in the foot and is
securely held in place by one screw. No rubber
is used at the top of the foot, but more is used on
the sole where it is most needed.</p>

<p>If a foot needs be made extremely light a fine
quality of felt is used in place of the rubber. The
felt does not give as much spring and elasticity to
the tread of the foot as the sponge rubber, and
nothing is gained by using it except reduction in
weight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/figure216-218and267.jpg" width="350" height="400" alt="216 217 218 267" />
</div>

<p>To prevent wear at the part corresponding
with the toe joint of the natural foot, layers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
canvas are cemented on the upper surface of the
rubber sole where it comes in contact with the
extreme forward part of the wooden portion.
Should the rubber sole give way or wear out, the
worn part, or indeed the entire sole, may be renewed
at small expense without the necessity of
replacing the entire foot as in the old style of
rubber foot.</p>

<p>Altogether this is a lighter, stronger and more
serviceable foot, more easily and inexpensively
kept in order. A sectional view of this foot is
shown in No. 267.</p>

<p>Leg for amputation below the knee, without knee
joints or thigh support. This style of leg is hardly
suitable for stumps less than six inches in length.
With a sound stump of sufficient length it may be
worn with much satisfaction, as it is about one-third
lighter than one with the knee joints and thigh band,
and the wearer experiences much less restraint in its
use, both in walking and sitting. It is, however,
not recommended if the stump is sore or sensitive,
as the entire pressure or bearing must be taken on
the stump, with no provision for relieving it as with
the leg with thigh band. No. 230 shows the
leg with new foot, with rigid ankle No. 267, and
adjustable leather lacing socket. A wooden socket
with the same foot will be used if desired. Price,
complete, $45, warranted for one year; $55, three
years; $65, five years. If this leg is purchased,
and it subsequently proves unsatisfactory, knee joints
and thigh bands will be put on for $10.</p>

<h3><i>Amputations at or below the Ankle Joint</i></h3>

<p>Amputations at or below the ankle joint are
usually performed with the expectation that much
of the weight of the body can be borne on the end
of the stump or plantar surface of the remaining
part of the foot, and in most cases this can be done.
Owing to the little space below the end of the stump,
it is desirable, with few exceptions, to construct feet
for these amputations without articulated ankle
joints.</p>

the weight being supported by the leather sheath on the leg below
the knee. Price, $40.</p>

<p class="num"><span class="smcap">Number 270</span></p>

<p>An entirely new style of foot for amputation at the ankle joint.
The leather sheath encases the stump from the knee to the end.
The articulated joint is made by putting the bolt or cylinder entirely
through the foot, giving a good wearing surface similar to the artificial
knee joint used for amputations above the knee. If there
is little room below end of stump the foot would be made of hard
wood.</p>

<h3><i>Peg Legs</i></h3>

<p>These low-priced legs are carefully fitted, and,
excepting No. 242, are covered with rawhide and
enameled the same as the legs with feet. They
have heavy iron ferrules screwed to the bottom, in
which a rubber cushion is used. If desired at some
future time, a foot and ankle may be attached.
Measurements, mould, profiles, etc., same as for
leg with foot, excepting that no foot measurements
are required, and length of sound leg should be taken
with shoe on.</p>

<p>The prices include suspenders and stump stock.</p>

State whether for right or left leg. Price $8.</p>

</div>

<h3><i>Suspenders</i></h3>

<p>All artificial legs for thigh amputations require support
from shoulders or waist. For amputations at or
below the knee, except ankle joint and partial foot amputations,
it is desirable to have suspenders attached for
beginners. Many, however, discard them after a time.
All legs that we make requiring suspenders are equipped
with them, any form desired, without extra charge. We
are not confined to the styles illustrated; they will be
modified to suit the purchaser or any peculiarities of the case.</p>

<p class="num"><span class="smcap">Number 252</span></p>

<p>Suspender for leg amputation with forked straps to be attached
to artificial leg below the knee; heavy elastic web between the
buckle and fork; this is a popular style. Price, $1.50.</p>

<p class="num"><span class="smcap">Number 253</span></p>

<p>A waist belt for women to which elastic straps are attached in
back and front, or the forked strap in front only. This is for
amputation below the knee. It is, however, often used in connection
with suspenders, which pass over the shoulders, on legs
for thigh amputation. Price, complete for leg amputation, $2.</p>

<p class="num"><span class="smcap">Number 254</span></p>

<p>For women. Corset with roller suspenders attached to waist
belt, used when amputation is above the knee. This is a much
more convenient and comfortable support for women than any
kind of suspender straps. The belt or straps can be made to
attach to any corset. Price, including corset, $5.</p>

<p class="num"><span class="smcap">Number 255</span></p>

<p>Roller suspenders for leg for thigh amputation. Crossed or
looped behind and looped in front if desired. Price, $4.</p>

<p class="num"><span class="smcap">Number 256</span></p>

<p>The roller or pulley used on the roller suspenders. The action
of the straps under these rollers prevents drawing over the
shoulders, in stooping, sitting or lying down, the suspenders
remaining stationary on the shoulders. Price, 25 cents each.</p>

<p class="num"><span class="smcap">Number 257</span></p>

<p>Suspenders, partial elastic, of the ordinary pattern, for thigh
amputation; riveted so as to swivel on a leather strap laced
around the upper part of the socket. Price, $3.</p>

</div>

<p>The back part of the sockets of all legs for thigh amputations
is padded. This prevents the wear and cutting
of the clothing when sitting on a hard seat of any kind.
Without the padding, destruction of the clothing can
hardly be avoided.</p>

<p class="num"><i>Fitting Tool</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Number 258.</span> There are changes in stumps from
time to time requiring slight smoothing or easing out
in the socket. A wooden socket can most conveniently
and effectually be cut out with one of these
fitting tools, such as are used by artificial limb makers.
Price, $1.50.</p>

<p class="num"><i>Stump Socks</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Number 259.</span> Socks made from soft woolen yarn
are the most convenient and comfortable covering
that can be worn on a stump, with or without an
artificial leg. With a properly fitted socket, either
wood or leather, it is as much padding as is required.
To compensate for shrinkage of the stump, two or
three extra socks may be added from time to time
as required. It is desirable, however, if the stump
has become so much reduced that more covering than
this is needed, to have the socket lined with leather
or felt, and if it should still further reduce, a new
socket or top is the best remedy.</p>

<h3><i>Artificial Legs for Deformities</i></h3>

<p>We make limbs for all manner of deformities,
each one specially designed and constructed to
conform to the individual peculiarities. With a
fair degree of strength in the deficient limb, comfortable
support and probability of easy locomotion
are assured the wearers of these appliances. Rubber
or wooden foot can be used. Prices vary from
$50 to $100, according to the difficulties to be
overcome in proper construction and comfortable
fitting. After receiving full description, exact price
will be given. A plaster mould or cast of the
deformed limb should be forwarded, together with
measurements of sound limb, same as in case of an
amputation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Part_III"><span class="smcap">Part III</span><br />
<span class="smaller">ARTIFICIAL ARMS</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The construction of artificial arms may be said
to have commenced with the sixteenth century.
“The distinguished Chevalier Göetz fought
at the head of the army of Margrave Frederick from
1504 to 1562 with an artificial iron hand. The
fingers of this hand were closed one after the other
by the action of several springs. We are further
informed that this hand, which possessed enormous
weight, enclosed the stump, and was attached to
the armor which covered the body.”</p>

<p>During the sixteenth century many very defective
artificial arms were made, which, however,
served the purpose for which they were intended, as
they enabled the wearers to engage in battle, guide
their horses, etc. The artificial hand being once
attached to the weapon or bridle rein, mechanism
for articulating the fingers was not deemed necessary.</p>

<p>Ambrose Parè, a noted French physician, born
in 1500, and called the father of French surgery,
describes an artificial hand made of iron, with more
perfect mechanism than the one worn by Göetz;
in this hand the thumb is immovable and all the
fingers are opened and closed simultaneously under
the influence of a single spring.</p>

<p>During Ambrose Parè’s time efforts were
made to restore natural movements of the lost parts
in order to enable the maimed to perform all
ordinary labor. Leather, paper, and other metals
were substituted for iron. Parè leaves a figure of
a leather hand, but without details as to its mechanism;
it is apparently made with immovable fingers
and thumb, but with a sheath inserted between the
thumb and index finger for receiving a pen, etc.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
He further describes an artificial forearm, which
can, by the aid of the sound hand, be brought into
any degree of flexion and maintained there by the
use of a pawl caught into meshes of a cog wheel.
The artificial arms described by Ambrose Parè,
although extremely heavy, seem to have been in
favor until the latter part of the eighteenth century;
at this time a monk of the order of Carmelites
designed a hand made of sheet tin, with movable
fingers and thumb, to be articulated by movement
of the stump, but we are informed that it was too
complicated to be used with any degree of success
except in cases of amputation near the wrist joint.
We have a description of an arm made subsequently
of leather and covered with sheepskin, colored
in such a manner as to represent the appearance
of the human skin, and to make it appear
more natural the nails were made of white horn.
The improvements in the hand were mostly in the
appearance, without any important addition to its
utility or usefulness.</p>

<p>In 1818 a Dr. Graefe suggested the construction
of an arm susceptible of manipulation by
means of cords attached to a corset surrounding
the shoulders, the arm to be moved without the
aid of the sound hand. This principle of attachment
for the movement of the forearm and fingers
is followed to the present time with various
modifications.</p>

<p>The early history of artificial arms seems to
refer mainly to their special construction and application
for people of renown who had suffered the
loss of their natural extremities. Until a comparatively
recent period the impracticability, on account
of complicated heavy mechanism, and the great expense
of these appliances, precluded anything like
a general demand for their use. As the inventive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
geniuses of modern times have devised and produced
so many labor and time-saving instruments
and machines, that are, however useful, nevertheless
the cause of much horrible mutilation
of humanity, so also have they in some measure
made compensation to the maimed by the progress
and improvement attained in the utility of the
appliances for the substitution of lost members.
Simplicity of mechanism, the application of extremely
light material in such a manner as to preserve
the necessary strength, are the prominent
features of progress in artificial arm construction,
and in combination with the prevailing moderate
prices, bring them into popular favor with those
who have use for them.</p>

<p>However light, strong and mechanically perfect
an arm and hand may be made, its success or
failure—provided the stump is sound and of sufficient
length—depends much upon the continued
patience and perseverance of the wearer in getting
accustomed to its use. The preservation of the
form and the general improvement in the appearance
produced by a properly constructed and
comfortably fitted arm, to say nothing of its usefulness
and convenience, should be an incentive
to persistent effort on the part of the wearer to
habituate himself to it, and if this is practiced
for a few weeks there need be no fear of the
ultimate result.</p>

<h3><i>Sockets for the Stumps</i></h3>

<p>For amputation below the elbow the neatest
and best fitting socket is made from specially prepared
stiff leather moulded over a cast of the stump,
supported with a framework of steel and lined
with buckskin or kid. The advantages over a
wooden socket are that it is less clumsy, adheres
more closely to the stump, that there is no danger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
of splitting, and withal is equally as durable. We
make them, however, of wood if desired. For
amputation above the elbow the artificial elbow is
made of wood, and it is sometimes desirable to
extend the wood upward in one piece to form
the socket.</p>

<h3><i>Aluminum</i></h3>

<p>Much has been anticipated and hoped for in
artificial limb work from this new and extremely
light metal, but it has proved objectionable for any
parts in both arms and legs that come in near contact
with the stumps, owing to the rapid oxidization
that takes place from perspiration, and its practical
use is confined to fingers, toes, and such other minor
fixtures as are not likely to come in contact with
any part of the body.</p>

<h3><i>Artificial Hands</i></h3>

<p>Whatever their mechanical perfection, artificial
hands can, in fact, possess but one useful
quality, that of seizing objects like pincers. In
nearly every act performed by the natural fingers
are combined flexion, extension, prehension, and
many other different movements; this combination
no mechanic has ever been able—and probably
none ever will be able—to successfully reproduce
in an artificial hand. It is, therefore, practically
useless that the fingers should be movable, since a
less complicated, lighter and stronger hand can be
made with fingers rigid, in a half-closed, natural
position, articulating the thumb only, which results
in a more powerful spring and consequently a
greater degree of firm grasping power. The fingers
being strengthened with steel plates running through
them, reinforced with a covering of rawhide, and
securely fastened to the hand, heavy objects may be
lifted without danger of the fingers straightening out
and the object dropping to the ground.</p>

<p>While we furnish the hand with movable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
fingers, and the rubber hand with ductile rubber
fingers, the wooden hand with rigid fingers and
movable thumb is recommended as giving the most
practical, durable, and satisfactory service.</p>

<h3><i>The Color</i></h3>

<p>Artificial hands are covered with a delicately
tinted enamel, as nearly a flesh color as it is possible
to make; but in order that they may be less conspicuous
and the illusion more complete a glove
should be worn at all times. We furnish a pair of
gloves with each hand.</p>

<h3><i>Tools and Implements</i></h3>

<p>Tools and implements in almost limitless variety
can be used in an arm in place of the hand. Those
most frequently used are the plain hook, double hook,
ring, knife, fork, brush, and spoon. People who
have never worn arms hardly know what will be of
service to them. Special tools are required for
special work, and these can be subsequently provided
when it has been determined what will be most
useful. With all arms with detachable hands, or
rubber hands with the palm socket, we furnish a plain
hook, knife, fork, and brush, without extra charge,
or the price of any of these implements that are
not wanted will be deducted from the price of
the arm.</p>

<h3><i>Finger Construction</i></h3>

<p>Usually the fingers for artificial hands are
made of a single piece of wood, and it is obvious if
the finger is curved or flexed that at some point the
grain of the wood will be directly across the finger
and will quickly break if subjected to any considerable
strain. To obviate this difficulty we
make the fingers for the wooden hands of two
pieces of wood; on one side the grain or fibre runs
lengthwise, and on the other crosswise, and between
these two pieces of wood is placed a steel plate, and
all are firmly riveted together, the steel plate projecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
sufficiently to be securely riveted to the hand.
The fingers are next entirely covered with rawhide,
which, together with the other precautions taken
against breakage, make them sufficiently strong to
support the weight of the wearer. See No. 300,
<a href="#Page_64">page 64</a>.</p>

<h3><i>Partial Amputation of Hand</i></h3>

<p>No. 301 (<a href="#Page_64">page 64</a>) represents a stump after
partial amputation of the hand, leaving free use of
thumb, but it is with difficulty that this can be
brought in contact with the remaining stump so as
to be of service. No. 302 represents, for stumps of
this description, a wooden sheath, terminating in
immovable fingers partially closed, the hand being
attached to the wrist and forearm by means of a
leather lacing attachment. The sheath is covered
with rawhide and enameled, and the fingers made as
shown in No. 300. Price $40.</p>

<p>Should there be amputation at the base of two
or three fingers only, with no impairment in the
movements of the remaining one or two, so that
they can be brought in firm contact with the thumb,
what is left of such a mutilated hand is far more
useful than anything that can possibly be made to
supplement it, but to conceal the loss and give the
hand a more perfect appearance, fingers can be
made and applied as represented by No. 302, over
which a glove should be worn.</p>

<p>Nos. 303 and 304 (<a href="#Page_64">page 64</a>) show an apparatus
useful in all kinds of labor for persons who
have undergone a partial amputation of the hand.
It consists of a leather sheath, laced to the forearm.
Attached to the under surface of this sheath is a
steel plate, which extends downward under the
stump, turning up slightly at the end. At the end
is an aperture through which it is possible to slip
the handles of tools and implements, passing them
beneath the stump, where they are securely held in
place by pressure of the stump. Price $20.</p>

<p>No. 305 represents a stump after an amputation
of all the fingers and thumb, and No. 306 an
artificial wooden hand for same, with stationary
fingers and articulated thumb with a powerful spring
to be opened with the assistance of the sound hand.
Price $40.</p>

<h3><i>Rubber Hand</i></h3>

<p>With the assistance of the other hand, or by
pressing against some resisting body, the ductile
rubber fingers of the hand No. 307 may be
changed in position to suit the needs of the wearer
as shown by the dotted lines in the illustration.
For those who prefer the rubber to the wooden
hand it will be furnished with any of the arms we
make. It can be attached permanently to the forearm,
detachable at the wrist, with provision for
using a hook of other implement in place of the
hand, or furnished with a palm socket and lock for
the use of hook, knife, fork, etc., without removing
the hand. See No. 308.</p>

<h3><i>Connections</i></h3>

<p>No. 309 represents a new method for connecting
the hand and arm. Heretofore the devices
in use could not be absolutely relied upon to keep
the hand or tools in place. It mattered not how
strongly the fingers were made for lifting heavy
weights, the customary spring or set-screw used for
locking this connection was liable to loosen or
give way without warning and cause much annoyance,
if not injury. On the hand plate two studs
are riveted, the heads of which pass into keyholes
in the arm plate. With a slight turn of the hand
the heads pass into the slots of the keyholes, bringing
the heads of the studs under the arm plate;
they are kept immovable with a spring that automatically
slips into a slot in the edge of the plate;
the spring is released by a pressure of the thumb of
the sound hand in twisting the artificial hand off.
The hook and other tools have a lug at the end of
the spindle or shank; after passing the shank
through the hole in the center of the arm plate, it
is turned to any desired position and held firmly in
place with the wing nut, as shown in No. 310.</p>

<h3><i>Some of the Implements</i></h3>

<p>Some of the implements that may be attached
in the wrist plate when the hand is removed are
also shown in the illustration. All excepting the
brush are made of steel, or other suitable metal.</p>

<p>Special knife, fork, brush, and hook will be
made for use in the palm of rubber hand, No. 308,
without additional charge. Other tools, such as
pincers, claw hook, clevis, etc., will be made to
order when desired.</p>

<h3><i>Wrist Joint Amputations</i></h3>

<p>These usually leave a stump somewhat larger at
the end than immediately above (see No. 318, <a href="#Page_64">page
64</a>), thus providing a means of securely applying the
arm and keeping it in place without the necessity of
attachment above the elbow, as shown in No. 319.</p>

<p>Attachments above the elbow may, however,
be put on if thought best, and for amputation at or a
short distance above the wrist it is preferable to make
the connection at the elbow with leather straps,
as shown in No. 320, rather than with steel joints.</p>

<p>The socket of any arm for amputation between
wrist and elbow will be made to lace if desired.</p>

<p>No. 321 represents arm for amputation below
the elbow, leather socket and leather lacer above
the elbow, both reinforced with steel frame, connected
at elbow with steel joint straps.</p>

<p>No. 322 is a detachable wooden hand, with
rigid fingers and movable thumb. A traction rod
for opening the thumb with motion of shoulder is
shown in the illustration; a web strap is buttoned
to the upper end of the traction rod and passes over
opposite shoulder, as shown in No. 326, <a href="#Page_70">page 70</a>.
Any motion of the shoulder that will draw on this
rod will open the thumb, and when the tension is
released a strong spring in the thumb brings it back
in contact with the first finger. For single amputations
there is little or no advantage in having this
attachment put on; it necessarily requires more
complicated and expensive mechanism, without any
practical gain to the wearer. For double amputations
something of this kind must be depended
upon for assistance, and to obtain the greatest
benefit from artificial arms, means similar to this
for operating the movement of the thumb are
absolutely required. One or more movable fingers
in conjunction with the thumb may be operated in
the same manner.</p>

<h3><i>Ball-and-Socket Wrist Joint</i></h3>

<p>No. 323 represents arm with ball-and-socket
wrist joint for amputation below the elbow, but
not suitable for an amputation near the wrist for
the reason that the space in that locality is required
for the mechanism of the joint. In the various
uses to which an artificial hand may be put, a
change in the position of the hand is often desirable;
for example, in keeping a book or paper in position
while being written upon with the sound hand, the
artificial hand can be turned so that the tips of the
fingers will rest upon and hold the article securely
in place. In bringing the arm in front of the
body the ball-and-socket joint admits of the hand
being brought near to the body in a very easy, lifelike
manner. In other positions desired the hand
may be placed at the degree of flexion most convenient
and helpful and that giving the most natural
appearance. No. 332, on <a href="#Page_72">page 72</a>, gives an illustration
of the details of the joint. The forearm
and attachment above the elbow are leather, supported
with steel framework same as No. 321.
Wooden hand with movable thumb is furnished
with or without traction rod for opening thumb
with shoulder movement, but no provision is made
for the use of a hook or other implement in place
of the hand. A rubber hand with palm socket for
implements can be attached if preferred, but is
somewhat heavier. For persons not employed in
laborious occupations and who have no occasion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
to use a hook or similar implement, this style of
arm is desirable; for others we would recommend
No. 321.</p>

<h3><i>For Deformed Arm</i></h3>

<p>No. 324, <a href="#Page_66">page 66</a>, represents irregularly
formed forearm and hand, the forearm being considerably
shorter than the opposite one. No. 325
represents artificial arm and hand made to supply
the deficiency. The hand may be wood or rubber
and detachable or not at the wrist, and provision
made for the use of implements the same as in
case of an amputation. These malformations are
treated mechanically the same as amputations.
Plaster moulds or casts of the deformed parts are
required, together with measurements of the opposite
arm and hand.</p>

<h3><i>Manner of Attaching Arm and Straps</i></h3>

<p>No. 326 illustrates arm for amputation below
the elbow, equipped with shoulder cap, strap passing
around body for holding it in place, and the attachment
for opening the thumb
by movement of the opposite
shoulder. If thumb is to
be opened with the assistance
of the sound hand, this extra
strap and traction rod are
omitted.</p>

<h3><i>Arm for Amputation above the Elbow</i></h3>

<p>No. 327 on <a href="#Page_72">the next page</a> represents a wooden
arm for amputation above the elbow, fitted with
cord for raising forearm and locking it at right
angles. This is operated as shown in No. 330,
while the mechanism is the same as shown in
detailed drawing No. 332. Wooden or rubber
hand No. 328 is furnished permanently attached or
detachable, but this arm may be used as a peg,
without hand, hook No. 310 or other implement
being used in place of the hand. It can also be
made as a peg without a joint at elbow, straight or
curved to any desired angle.</p>

<h3><i>Manner of Attaching</i></h3>

<p>No. 330 represents the corset that is used with
arms for upper amputation. The arm is laced or
buckled to the corset, and draught cord in the back
is for raising the forearm by a shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<h3><i>Ball-and-Socket Wrist Joint for Amputation above the Elbow</i></h3>

<p>No. 331 represents wooden arm for amputation
above the elbow, with ball-and-socket wrist
joint. An explanation of the ball-and-socket wrist
for amputation below the elbow is given on <a href="#Page_69">page 69</a>
under No. 323. The joint is universal and admits
of placing the hand in any position, as shown by
dotted lines. This is kept in place by spring friction
on the ball. The wrist cannot be made quite
the natural shape—that we are able to produce
without the ball-and-socket joint; but this must be,
necessarily, round. This part, however, is usually
covered with the cuff or sleeve and is not conspicuous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span></p>

<p>No. 332 is a sectional view of the arm and
hand. A forward impulse of the shoulder and
stump causes traction of the cord, moving the
geared segment wheels so as to raise the forearm to
any degree of flexion, when it is retained in position
by means of a latch passing through a spring post
and locking automatically. The wearer is enabled
to conveniently carry a coat, shawl, basket, etc.,
on the artificial arm. A pressure on the button
underneath the arm releases the lock, and the forearm
is again under control of the stump and
shoulders. The spring in the hand is for keeping
the thumb in position and is the same as we put in
all hands with movable thumb.</p>

hand, and no such person can afford to be without
one for a day. The blade is thin steel, ground to
a sharp edge and terminating in a fork. A rolling
motion will cut the food, and a twist of the hand
will bring the fork into position for use. No. 334
represents a leather sheath into which the knife can
be inserted.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
